# Auto-Password-Changer
I created this for the specific use of editing the password of the Yealink T46S Phone.
You can scan the entire 4th octate of an ip, and every url that sends a ping back 
with the same html elements as the Yeahlink T46S Phone's local website, the script 
will open Chrome, log in with either the default 'admin', 'admin', or you can 
select a custom user/pass in case you changed the user/pass somewhere along the 
way. It will then close the browser window when finished editing so you *shouldn't* 
have to click anything whilst this script runs :)

If you have any suggestions on how to make this code more efficient, or to add more useability, 
I'm always willing to improve, so do give me some feedback!
